This post is to provide quick definitions of a wallet and an account in crypto.

<!-- truncate -->

## Wallet

A wallet is a client (a piece of software) that manages accounts. It's a tool to provide your identity in web3, just ike a passport. It can be considered as a decentralised identity management tool.

## Account

An account is a public-private key pair derived from your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP). The address is the public key.

## Recovery phrase

A recovery phrase is to access the wallet and all the private keys stored in the wallet. As long as your recovery phase is the same, the calculation of the private keys will always have the same result.

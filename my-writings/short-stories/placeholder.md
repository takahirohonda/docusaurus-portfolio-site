## Draft

I was looking at the horizon, gradually dimming from the afterglow of the sunset. The ground was still damp from the evening rain. All I remembered was a flash of light. The next moment I saw three green men, or maybe women, but who knows I've never seen a woman in real life, standing right in front of me. They spoke in an alien language, their voices coming from a speaker attached to the collar of their space suits. No doubt hostile and ready to take us over. Their planet probably became uninhabitable, possibly from nuking each others. Their tech looked super advance. There was no chance in hell we could win an all-out space war against them.

I did not panic. Since my friend, the second-to-last man on Earth, died last month, I had come to accept my fate as the last man on Earth. But, I wasn't gonna go down easily without a fight. I would go down in history with my epic last struggle as a man.

The first instance of asexual reproduction in shark was observed at an aquarium in Vancouver. The cleaner found tiny sharks swimming in the shark tank where all of them were female one day. They reported the findings to their superior. Calls were made. The investigation concluded they were 100% genetically identical to one of them. Scientists concluded the absence of the males rewired the female reproductive system.

A similar phenomenon was observed among a captive exclusively female population of zebra at a zoo in Toronto. A baby zebra was discovered by a zookeeper who entered the enclosure to top up their food pile of hay and alfalfa at the start of their shift. Genetic tests confirmed that the cub was in fact from one of the zebras from the herd. They also had identical zebra patterns. Each zebra has unique patterns on their body. Up to that point, the scientists debated if the patterns were formed genetically or environmentally. It settled the debate. Zebras inherit their patterns from their parents. The environment has no influence.

It was only a matter of time for this phenomenon to be observed among an exclusively female monkey population in captivity.

The first instance of asexual reproduction in humans was observed in a women's prison in Baltimore. A female inmate who had not had contact with a male over a decade gave birth to a baby genetically identical to herself.

More and more women started reproducing asexually by spontaneous zygotic cell division simply by staying away from men. It caused a male population to decline quickly. As the gender balance tipped, women took power and decided to make men obsolete. Why the fuck not? They are stupid. The world congress unanimously passed the law to ban sexual reproduction and keep the remaining men in a designated humanitarian reserve where the precise location was kept secret. Women were completely isolated from men and sexual reproduction ceased entirely.

So, here I am - the last man on Earth. I am the last sexually reproduced human being. Babies are clones of their mothers. All new humans being born on Earth are women. No male will ever be born again. None of us succeeded in reproducing asexually. Sperm is useless. These hostile aliens no doubt have ray guns. They'll shoot me and slaughter the rest of the women. I'm going to evaporate instantly or pop like a balloon. Whatever. Since I am the last man standing, no doubt I have the biggest penis on Earth. We human will not go down without a fight. I'm gonna declare a war against those green suckers and fight till the end. Here it comes. Let me give them a piece of my mind.

At a conference room in the White House, the madam president was shaking hands with the same green men. They came in peace. Their voices emanated from a speaker box attached to the collars of their space suits. Some kind of advanced alien tech enabled them to communicate in our language. One of them said, 'We learned a customary greeting from the first human we encountered last night. Let us try.' In perfect synchrony, the three of them raised what appeared to be their middle fingers and solemnly declared in robotic unison, 'Suck my dick, Madam president.'

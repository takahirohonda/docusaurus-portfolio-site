## List of things to do...

- Play with YouTube Data API to get a list of videos maybe from a playlist

https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list

```bash
https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos

https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos/?&list=PLl3_a4EzgdPozGQyARnTZzjLbCmm6_25N
```

We already have react-image-gallery, so we can use it like below..
